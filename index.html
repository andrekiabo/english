            <h3><a href="pag001.html">The Endless Tale 01</a></h3>
            <p>In the Far East there was a Great King who had no work to do. Every day, and
                all day long, he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories. And no matter
                what the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even though
                many of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with your
                story,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world were
                invited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very long
                indeed.</p>
            <h3><a href="pag002.html">The Endless Tale 02</a></h3>
            <p>But The King was always sad when the story ended.At last he sent a message
                to every city and town, offering a prize to any one able to tell him an endless
                tale. He said: “To the man that will tell me a story which lasts forever, I will
                give my daughter as his wife; and I will make him my heir, and he shall be king
                after me.” But this challenge wasn’t quite what it seemed. The King added a
                strict condition. “If any man tries to tell such a story and fails, then his head
                will be cut off.”</p>
                <h3><a href="pag003.html">The Endless Tale 03</a></h3>
            <p>The King's daughter was very beautiful, and many young men in The
                Kingdom were willing to do anything to win her. But none of them wanted to
                lose his head, and so only a few tried for the prize. One young man invented
                a story that lasted three months; but after that, he could think of nothing
                more. His fate was a warning to others, and it was a long time before another
                storyteller was daring enough to take the King's challenge.</p>
