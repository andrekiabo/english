  <h1>Texto para treinamento</h1>  
      <p>In the Far East there was a Great King who had no work to do. Every day, and
        all day long, he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories. And no matter
        what the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even though
        many of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with your
        story,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world were
        invited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very long
        indeed.</p>
