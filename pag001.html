              <p style="text-align:justify ;">  In the Far East there was a Great King who had no work to do. Every day, and
                all day long, he sat on soft cushions and listened to stories. And no matter 
                what the story was about, he never grew tired of hearing it, even though
                many of the stories took hours to complete. “There is only one fault with your 
                story,” he often said, “it is too short.” All the storytellers in the world were
                invited to his palace; and some of them told stories that were very long
                indeed.</p>
