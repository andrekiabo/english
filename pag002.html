        <h1>Texto para treinamento</h1>
        <p>But The King was always sad when the story ended.At last he sent a message
            to every city and town, offering a prize to any one able to tell him an endless <br>
            tale. He said: “To the man that will tell me a story which lasts forever, I will 
            give my daughter as his wife; and I will make him my heir, and he shall be king <br>
            after me.” But this challenge wasn’t quite what it seemed. The King added a
            strict condition. “If any man tries to tell such a story and fails, then his head
            will be cut off.”</p>
