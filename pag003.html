                The King's daughter was very beautiful, and many young men in The
                Kingdom were willing to do anything to win her. But none of them wanted to
                lose his head, and so only a few tried for the prize. One young man invented
                a story that lasted three months; but after that, he could think of nothing
                more. His fate was a warning to others, and it was a long time before another
                storyteller was daring enough to take the King's challenge.
